# Tests

These are unit tests written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/).

There are fixtures in `conftest.py` that set up the Flask app (as a [fixture](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/testing/#fixtures)) to be used in the unit tests.

See [Testing Flask Applications](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/testing/)
